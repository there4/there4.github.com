For some types of stuck, adding constraints can reduce the burden of choices. For instance, a full page design my feel overwhelming, but designing first for mobile may reduce the information to a manageable set of decisions.

Likewise with development, choices can feel like a burden. But, with added constraints you can relieve some of these. Perhaps with your application you are staring into the abyss considering data synchronization and needing an api design, a data store, and a decision about synchronization strategies. In this case you could potentially add some fixture data to the web application to remove the need for the api, use local storage to eliminate the data store for the time being and then keep developing. Momentum is won in small wins built over time.

This doesnâ€™t mean that you should allow your project to grow organically. However, in identifying which parts can be run concurrently, or that be mocked while waiting for more information, more inspiration, or more time, you can keep a project un-stuck by working on smaller pieces.

If you are going to eat an elephant, you must do it bite by bite.
