I've just released a new project to render [FogBugz][fb] Widgets on [Geckoboard][gb].
You can checkout the code on via GitHub for the project at 
[FogBugz GeckoBoard Widgets](https://github.com/there4/fogbugz-geckoboard).

This will power widgets that can deliver:

* Kiln activity RSS in a shorter format
* A list of what each developer is working on
* A list of cases by filter id
* Stacked bar graph of current critical, high, and normal cases by count.
